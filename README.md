# Custom Content Management System

Decided to create this fullstack application in order to have a platform where I can add and update content on future static web applications (Such as my portfolio) without having to dive back into the code. The project also serves to help me understand fullstack tecnology stacks and workflows better.

## What technologies am I using for this project?

The application was bootstrapped using the `create-t3-app` command and includes the following technologies

- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
